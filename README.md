# Debloat11

> **Warning:** This is a *very, very experimental* project.

Debloat11 is a project aimed at exposing and adding features and tweaks that, in the author's opinion, **should already be part of Windows** by default.

---

## What is Debloat11?

Windows is a powerful operating system, but it often ships with unnecessary bloat, missing features, or options buried deep inside menus. Debloat11 attempts to bring some of these hidden or missing improvements to light, enabling users to customize and optimize their experience.

**Note:** This project is highly experimental and may cause unexpected behavior. Use at your own risk.
